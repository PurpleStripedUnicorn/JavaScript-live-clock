# JavaScript live clock
This is a small project to make it easier to incorporate a live clock into your
website or just a single webpage.

## How it works
You include the live-clock.js javascript file in the head part of your html
file. Next, you assign all elements that you want to be a live clock the
attribute "data-live-clock". It should now work.
